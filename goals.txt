GOALS FOR GAME JAM:

Use what I know (Polygon / ColorRect simple art.)
Create some simple components I can re-use in other games.


Theme:


Tiny Creatures

Innovation – The unexpected. Things in a unique combination, or something so different it’s notable.
Fun – How much you enjoyed playing a game. Did you look up at the clock, and found it was 5 hours later?
Theme – How well an entry suits the theme. Do they perhaps do something creative or unexpected with the theme?
Graphics – How good the game looks, or how effective the visual style is. Nice artwork, excellent generated or geometric graphics, charming programmer art, etc.
Audio – How good the game sounds, or how effective the sound design is. A catchy soundtrack, suitable sound effects given the look, voice overs, etc.
Humor – How amusing a game is. Humorous dialog, funny sounds, or is it so bad it’s good?
Mood – Storytelling, emotion, and the vibe you get while playing.
Overall – Your overall opinion of the game, in every aspect important to you.




What is the game?

Tiny Friend -- A cozy 2D platformer about a Big Guy and a Little Guy who follows him around (like a child.)
--The tiny guy can get into small spaces where the big guy can't 

“For small creatures such as we, the vastness [of the universe] is made bearable only through love,” [Cosmos]

Feeling big, and feeling small
--taking damage shrinks you?



Mechanics:
Eye spy / where's waldo
Mario mushroom (powerup / ability to change character's size.)
wiggling animation?

Camera:
Scale -- camera zooming in and out
Switching focus -- between different objects
Shrinking / expanding mechanic -- objects changing in size, shrinking for a time  to complete puzzles



/////////////////

Big map? , collect all 10  tiny friends



=================================================================

tiny friends should be independent of each other by default

signals:

player.request_return
player.change_control

player.thrown
friend._on_thrown


Goals:
# Define an arena with a platform that the main character can move around on.
# Make a little character that follows the main character around.
# Press a button to switch control from the main character to the smaller character
# Press a button to "recall" your tiny friends -- they will try to find their way back to you. ???
# Press a button to throw your tiny friend (one by one) (hold shift and click)
# Add a script to calculate the throw trajectory and display on screen
# Add a counter on the top left to indicate how many tiny friends are attached to the player (x1/10, x2/10)
# When you throw one, the counter goes down. When one makes it back, the counter goes up. 
# Make trajectory match mouse position


#Make friends bounce off of walls
# Fix right side bounce being worse than left side bounce
# Handle collecting multiple friends at once and having them all follow you around
# --hide marker for friends who are not available
# Friends should not collide with each other
# -When control is activated, the green aura disappears. skip
# tab to cycle through thrown friends?
left click to throw all as a group?



Goals for today:
# -Can only change control between friends that have been thrown (green aura).
# -Friends that have been returned stay returned when switching control.
# -You can only control one friend at a time.
# -Pressing tab cycles through friends to control.

Add sounds:
# jumping
# throwing friends
# bouncing friends
# return
# collecting new friend

# Create camera that moves forward / backward based on x-position?
# prevent moving backward?
# Create door that moves camera or changes scenes (user a fixed size window/vieport.)
# Fix trajectory (top should align with movement
# add death
# jump buffer and coyote time for player
# jump buffer and coyote time for friends
# Press "E" to interact
# Add a lever object (or floor button) that friends can interact with (flip on/off)
# Make lever cause a bridge to appear
# fix double jump on player script
Add spikes that cause the level to reset (maybe just queue_free() until all players are dead?)

=================================================================


Goals:

Need level ideas, additional collectables / mechanics?
-Keys (collect to unlock doors--add count to HUD? (some backtracking, maybe?)
-Bubbles (collectables such as keys can be stuck inside. Throw a friend to pop a bubble.)
-Rocks/Boulders (can push--using players or friends? -- boulders can hide tiny places for friends to enter)





          



=================================================================

LEVELS:

10 Levels (10 friends)
Level 1: No friends, just door
Level 2: Collect first friend




=================================================================

Notes:
Set level to debug in camera node export
Change which friends are auto-attached 


Stretch goals:
CHAINING -- Allow the player to employ multiple tiny friends at the same time, and chain them together.
(If you have more than one come into contact, they automatically chain?
