16 by 9 common for most games
low res good for quick game jams, pixel art games

Godot:
Display, Window

pick either portrait or landscape mode?
godot defaults to landscape

You design the game at a reference Resolution
Common resolutions (steam hardware survey)
1920x1080

UI: Use canvas layer node
canvas layer node independent of camera position
can also change z index of elements (draw order)

Theme Overrides -> Constants

How to align UI elements?
Containers: Parent asks child, "how big do you want to be?" and sizes itself appropriately
Containers (grid container)
--only work on green UI elements (derived from Control), not sprites or anything else.
(can use TextureRect, with fit width expand mode, and stretch mode keep aspect centered )

replace Panel, with PanelContainer, make gridcontainer child of panelcontainer
extra space: use margin container
canvas layer, panel container, margin container, grid container


Themes: create new resource
eyedropper, select element to change style
can set by individual elements, or root UI (green) element
all labels / ui elements will inherit theme from root node (unless they have their own theme)
3rd way: project settings, advanced, GUI>Theme>Custom, save and restart editor
theme "+" button adds a new type
scene > reload saved scene (UI elements don't check if theme has changed.)

Change node size: Control Layout, Container Sizing
Expand: request all the space the parent container can give (Give me ALL the space!)
if multiple expand: split among the children
stretch ratio: for expand, sums up the stretch ratios (1+1 = 2)
stretch ratio / sum (1/2 + 1/2 = 1)
1+3=4 (1/4 and 3/4)

expand determines the size requested, while horiz/vert fill mode determines how it uses that space
center container but has no expand option
can also use spacer control nodes

control settings also above viewport instead of clicking in sidebar


...96


Changing window size: use anchors
position is relative to anchor position

smaller resolution: shrink/scale
project settings -> window -> stretch mode
canvas_items (use this)
viewport

aspect -- keep, keep_width, keep_height, expand (makes width and height bigger)

Godot:
CanvasLayer
HBoxContainer / Control node anchor bottom left, scale around size of object

To scale size of joystick -- Display > Window
Stretch viewport, aspect expand

Change max resolution -- same resolution when maximized
to fix, change viewport width and height to 1080p (1920 by 1080)
To allow player to set resolution in game:
get_viewport().size = Vector2(960, 720)

default resolution of monitor:
DisplayServer.screen.get_size()



====================================================================


pong test:

current resolution:
960 by 720
resizable is off
stretch mode disabled, aspect keep
export: project settings


new mode:
stretch mode: canvas items (more smooth / blurry, less exact)
aspect: keep width

export in adaptive mode for html

add pause button somewhere in case esc doesn't work?
or change from ESC to Backspace or something

====================================================================

StyleBoxFlat inherits from StyleBox > Resource > RefCounted > Object
"A customizable StyleBox that doesn't use a texture."

StyleBoxTexture inherits from StyleBox > Resource.... (A texture-based nine-patch StyleBox.)

PlaceholderTexture2D inherits from Texture2D > Texture > Resource > RefCounted > Object
"Placeholder class for a 2-dimensional texture."
"Texture for 2D and 3D."

Both inherit from Resource (Texture vs StyleBox)


 Panel + StyleBoxTexture

 flappy bird test:
 
 original:
 1220 x 720
 Resizable off
 Strecth disabled, keep aspect
 Export: Canvas resize policy, project
 
 
 new:
 resizable on
 canvas items, keep
 --ground is not repeating quick enough, pipes seem to spawn too low (fixed by hardcoding game resolution)
